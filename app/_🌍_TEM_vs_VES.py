    r"""
    Deciding where to drill a borehole is one of the most consequential (and costly) steps
    in a groundwater investigation. Drilling is expensive, and a dry or unproductive well
    wastes resources and delays access to water. Geophysical methods allow imaging of the
    subsurface **before drilling**, mapping the depth, thickness, and physical properties of
    aquifer materials across a site.

    A key physical property in geophysical mapping of groundwater is **electrical resistivity**.
    Resistivity varies with lithology, saturation, and, to some extent, water quality. Saturated sands and
    gravels are moderately conductive, clay-rich layers are highly conductive, basement rock
    is resistive, and saline water dramatically lowers resistivity. By mapping resistivity
    with depth, we can identify potential aquifer horizons, estimate depths to the water table,
    and detect saline intrusion. 
    
    Two methods that  are sensitive to subsurface resistivity are the **TEM** (transient electromagnetic) 
    and **VES** (vertical electrical sounding) methods: both map the subsurface resistivity structure, 
    but they work in fundamentally different ways.
